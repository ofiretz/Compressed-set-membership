# Compressed-set-membership

This tool was part of my research.
I implemented an probabilistic pigeonhole-based space efficient set-membership data structure with manageable false positive rate for DNA sequences.

First, use TrieBuilder class for the construction of the tool (create an serializable object), then you can query it.
